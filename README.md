# OVERLEVENDE
This is an engine done by Roger Pérez Romera and Josep Sànchez Arbona.
This project began from a subject in the grade Videogamaes Design and Development in CITM UPC Terrassa, we are two in-progress developers that want to give the best experience
through our engine: Overlende. 

In the next link you will find all the game information and documentation in the project's repository:

# How to use Overlevende Engine:

First of all you will want to identificate the menu bar in the engine, it has 3 drop down options that you can select by left clicking on one of them and moving around the
other. The first one, the “edit” menu will allow you to configure the engine at your own taste and exit the engine, you must know that the following options will be implement
ed at the next versions of the engine: new project, open project and save project. The “help” menu can be used to look for the engine’s information like documentation, 
versions and user’s help. Finally the “Github” menu contains all the links to the contributors of these projects for more information, content and their own engine’s project.

![Menu Bar]()

Once you are inside the engine you will see at least 5 different windows, you should be able to identicate the scene window at first sight and the others windows will be 
explained later on. Every window is able to be moved wherever you want on the engine window or outside without affecting its performance. You can do this by selecting the 
title bar of the window with the left click of the mouse and drag the window into a new position.
If the window is inside the engines window you can hide the title bar of each window using the upper left arrow, if they are outside the engines window you can use the same 
button to minimize the entire window.



- The configuration window:
	You can open the configuration window to edit some features of the motor or see some performance data. One of the new and remarkable features is the theme and color 
	editor, we think you will enjoy the motor more if you can personalize the aesthetic of your working space with the help of our designers to avoid eye-damaging 
	creations.

- The scene window:
	
	These will be where you will be working major of the time, so you can move around the camera using the mouse or the keyboard:
	* Mouse functionalities:
	Middle click and drag to move the camera around.
	Use the mouse wheel to get closer or further from an object.
	se right click and drag to turn the camera around.

	* Key functionalities:
	Use W/S to get closer or further in the scene.
	A/D will let you move left and right.
	F will focus your camera to the gameobject.
	While Right clicking, “WASD” fps-like movement and free look around is enabled.
	Shift will double the speed of movement.

	* Extra functionalities:
	You can use F1 to disable the grid in the scene window.
	You can use 0 to deselect the gameobject from the inspector.
	You can use 2 to create empty objects children of the general scene.

	You can drag a fbx to create a gameobject and see it in the scene, you can select this object and drop its texture too. If the model you import comes with textures 
	linked and they are in the same folder they will be imported at the same time as the fbx. Be aware that Overlevende shares some default assets to work with in the folder 
	“Assets” on files folder.

![Windows]()

- Hierarchy window:
	This is a simple window where you will see every game object, scene and components of your work. You can open tree groups to select every part of it.

- Options window:
	This window will help the user to take short cuts and make some actions when working with Overlevende: add primitive objects, enable or disable some options on 
	the scene window.

- Inspector window:
	This window shows you all the information to work with your gameobjects, by selecting your gameobject it will display its options like renaming the gameobject. 
	You can delete game objects from there too if necessary.

![Inspector]()

- Console:
	The console window shows errors, warnings and other messages generated by Overlevende. This will help you while working with the engine like showing some LOGs while 
	creating meshes.

# Additional features:

* We have added some interface themes, that was when we discovered ImGui and although is not hard code we think its good for the user to have a variety of interfaces colors 
to adapt at their necessities and make a better experience. So you will be able to change the base colors of the engine in a dark, light and bright theme and a few colors for
the active window and buttons.

* The camera of the main scene is linked to the scene window, so you can work with the scene in any position you like more and that’s a helpful tool.

* The option window has different new functionalities: for the game objects you can change to depth sight, activate the cull face, see or unsee the textures, the wireframe 
or normals. For the entire scene you can enable or disable the light too.
